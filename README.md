## Requirements

This project uses NodeJS, VUEJS and MongoDB. This is a summary of the project description. 

Project Goal: The project aims to expand an existing web application by adding new features and improving documentation. ​ The application follows a MEVN stack architecture (MongoDB, Express, VueJS, Node) and is a prototype implementation. ​

Background: The application is a basic data platform developed for a non-profit organization in the Houston area. ​It is used by Community Health Workers (CHWs) to help clients with basic needs. ​ The application allows CHWs to enter client information, create events, and sign up clients for events. ​ The data for all organizations is stored in a single database, with each organization having its own instance of the application. ​

Requirements:
- Update the code from Options API to Composition API. ​
- Add user login capabilities with different roles (viewers and editors). ​
- Implement CRUD functionality for services at the data layer. ​
- Extend the dashboard page with a pie or doughnut chart showing clients by zip code. ​

Sprints:
- Sprint 1: Create a Functional Specification Document 
- Sprint 2: Implement new features in the frontend using VueJS 
- Sprint 3: Expand the backend API, document the API, and create a presentation 
- Sprint 4: Peer evaluation of classmates' projects
